## Understanding Mental Models

We all have mental models of the world around us, and we use these mental models when we create and evaluate plans to achieve our goals. Simlin gives you the power to turn these implicit models explicit, so you can debug and improve them.

## System Dynamics

Simlin is built around the [system dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics) methodology, as introduced by the [Thinking in Systems](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/) book (among others).

You can learn more and connect with experts by engaging with the [System Dynamics Society](http://www.systemdynamics.org/).

Models are built in a simple, general visual language:
