# Asking Clarifying Questions

## Overview

Bridge the gap between raw user input and structured brainstorming by understanding what the user actually means, not what they said.

**Core principle:** Resolve contradictions first, then disambiguate. Conflicting goals must be reconciled before technical clarification - otherwise you're precisely defining the wrong thing.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the asking-clarifying-questions skill to make sure I understand your requirements correctly."

## When to Use

Use this skill:
- After gathering initial context from user
- Before starting brainstorming or design exploration
- When user mentions technical terms that could mean multiple things
- When scope boundaries are unclear
- When assumptions need verification

Do NOT use for:
- Exploring design alternatives (that's brainstorming)
- Proposing architectures (that's brainstorming)
- Validating completed designs (that's brainstorming Phase 3)
- Asking for initial requirements (that's start-design-plan Phase 1)

## Before Clarifying

Try to answer your own questions and disambiguate from the context of the working directory. Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "Explore"` to search the codebase for existing work that can help explain the subject under clarification. When you recognize elements such as common technologies or proper nouns, use a `general-purpose` subagent with WebSearch/WebFetch instructions to synthesize both codebase and internet searches.

## What to Clarify

### 0. Contradictions (First Pass)

Before disambiguating technical details, scan for logical contradictions in requirements. If the user has stated mutually exclusive goals, resolve these first - technical clarification is wasted effort if the foundation shifts.

**Look for:**

Explicit contradictions (user stated both):
- "Real-time updates" + "batch processing is fine" → Which is the actual need?
- "Keep it simple" + "handle every edge case" → Trade-off not acknowledged
- "Use existing patterns" + "complete rewrite" → Mutually exclusive approaches
- "No external dependencies" + "integrate with Stripe" → Implicit contradiction

Impossible combinations:
- "Offline-first" + "always-current data" → Physics problem
- "Fast to build" + "infinitely extensible" → Classic impossible triangle
- "Zero latency" + "synchronous validation" → Can't have both
- "No breaking changes" + "fundamental redesign" → Pick one

Unacknowledged trade-offs:
- "Simple" often conflicts with "flexible"
- "Fast" often conflicts with "thorough"
- "Cheap" often conflicts with "custom"
- "Secure" often conflicts with "convenient"

**How to surface:**

Don't accuse - illuminate the tension:
- "I notice you mentioned X and Y - these can pull in different directions. Which takes priority?"
- "There's a trade-off between A and B here. Which matters more for this project?"
- "These two goals sometimes conflict - how should I balance them when they do?"

**Why first:**
- Contradictions reveal unconfronted trade-offs
- Resolving them changes what "right" means
- Technical disambiguation without this = building the wrong thing precisely

**After contradictions are resolved**, proceed to technical clarification.

### 1. Technical Terminology

When user mentions technical terms, disambiguate what they actually mean.

**Examples:**

User says "OAuth2" -> Ask: Which flow?
- Authorization code flow (for human users with browser redirect)
- Client credentials flow (for service-to-service auth)
- Both, depending on the use case

User says "database" -> Ask: Which kind?
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data
- NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB) for flexible schema
- Already determined by existing infrastructure

User says "caching" -> Ask: What layer?
- Application-level (Redis, Memcached)
- HTTP caching (CDN, browser cache)
- Database query caching

**Use AskUserQuestion for these** - present specific options with trade-offs.

### 2. Scope Boundaries

When user mentions broad concepts, identify what's included and excluded.

**Examples:**

User says "users" -> Ask: Who exactly?
- Human users logging in via web browser
- Service accounts for API access
- Both, with different authentication flows
- Internal employees vs external customers

User says "integrate with X" -> Ask: What parts?
- Just authentication
- Full data sync
- Specific API endpoints
- Real-time webhooks vs batch imports

User says "reporting" -> Ask: What scope?
- Basic data export (CSV, Excel)
- Interactive dashboards
- Scheduled automated reports
- Real-time analytics

**Use AskUserQuestion** - present distinct scope options.

### 3. Assumptions and Constraints

When user states requirements, verify the underlying reasons and constraints.

**Examples:**

User says "must use library X" -> Ask: Why?
- Regulatory requirement (cannot change)
- Existing team expertise (preference, not hard requirement)
- Already in use elsewhere (consistency benefit)
- Misconception (might have better options)

User says "needs to be fast" -> Ask: How fast?
- Sub-100ms response time (hard requirement)
- Faster than current implementation (relative improvement)
- Perception of speed (optimistic UI, loading states)
- Actual performance bottleneck identified

User says "should follow pattern Y" -> Ask: Which aspect?
- Exact implementation (strict consistency)
- General approach (flexible adaptation)
- Just using same libraries (tooling consistency)
- Not actually required (outdated guideline)

**Use open-ended questions** for understanding "why" - allows user to explain context.

### 4. Version and API Specifics

When user mentions external services or libraries, verify current state.

**Examples:**

User says "integrate with Stripe" -> Check:
- Which Stripe API version (latest? specific?)
- Payment Intents API or older Charges API
- Which features needed (one-time, subscriptions, both)
- Already have Stripe account setup

User says "use React Router" -> Check:
- React Router v5 or v6 (breaking changes between versions)
- Already in use in codebase (follow existing patterns)
- Browser Router vs Hash Router vs Memory Router

**Quick agent queries for factual checks:**
- "What version of X exists?" -> Quick web search or codebase check
- "What's the current API?" -> Internet research for docs
- "Is Y already in use?" -> Codebase investigation

**Don't do deep research** - save that for brainstorming. Just verify basics.

### 5. Definition of Done (Required Final Step)

**Before handing off to brainstorming, you MUST establish the Definition of Done.**

The Definition of Done answers: "What does success look like? What are the deliverables?"

**After resolving contradictions and clarifying requirements:**

1. **Infer the Definition of Done** from context gathered so far:
   - What will exist when this is complete?
   - What will users/systems be able to do?
   - What are the concrete deliverables?

2. **If you have a firm grasp**, state it back and confirm:
   ```
   Use AskUserQuestion:
   "Based on our discussion, here's what I understand success looks like:

   [State the definition of done in 2-4 bullet points]

   Does this capture what you're trying to achieve?"

   Options:
   - "Yes, that's right" (proceed to brainstorming)
   - "Partially, but..." (user will clarify)
   - "No, let me explain..." (user will reframe)
   ```

3. **If the deliverables are still ambiguous**, ask targeted questions:
   - "What should exist when this is done?"
   - "How will you know this succeeded?"
   - "What's the minimum viable deliverable?"

**Why this matters:** Brainstorming explores *how* to achieve the goal. The goal must be locked in first. Otherwise you're exploring texture without knowing what shape you're filling.

**The Definition of Done becomes part of the output bundle** and will appear prominently at the top of the final design document.

## Question Techniques

### Use AskUserQuestion for Choices

When there are 2-4 distinct options with trade-offs:

```
Question: "Which OAuth2 flow are you targeting?"
Options:
  - "Authorization code flow" (human users with browser redirect)
  - "Client credentials flow" (service-to-service automated auth)
  - "Both flows" (supports human users AND service accounts)
```

**Benefits:**
- Forces explicit choice
- Shows trade-offs clearly
- Prevents vague "maybe both" responses
- Structured for decision-making

### Use Open-Ended Questions for Why

When you need to understand reasoning or context:

"Why is X a requirement?"
"What problem does Y solve?"
"What happens if we don't include Z?"

**Benefits:**
- Uncovers hidden constraints
- Reveals user's mental model
- Identifies assumptions to challenge
- Provides context for brainstorming

### Use Quick Queries for Facts

When you need to verify something factual:

- Dispatch Explore agent: "Is library X already in use?"
- Quick web search: "What's the current version of API Y?"
- File read: "Check package.json for existing auth dependencies"

**Don't get distracted** - these are quick checks, not research projects.

## Output: Context Bundle for Brainstorming

After clarification, create a clear summary to pass to brainstorming:

**Resolved trade-offs:**
- Speed over flexibility (chose simple implementation, accept less configurability)
- Security over convenience (chose strict validation, accept more friction)
- Consistency over ideal (chose existing patterns, accept suboptimal in isolation)

**Clarified requirements:**
- OAuth2 client credentials flow (service-to-service)
- External customers only (not internal employees)
- Stripe Payment Intents API (latest version)
- Must comply with PCI DSS Level 1 (regulatory constraint)
- "Fast" means sub-200ms p99 response time (measured requirement)

**Verified assumptions:**
- React Router v6 already in use (follow existing patterns)
- PostgreSQL database (existing infrastructure)
- No existing auth system (greenfield)

**Scope boundaries:**
- IN: Service account creation, token issuance, token validation
- OUT: Human user login, SSO integration, password management

This bundle gives brainstorming a concrete, unambiguous starting point.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Ignoring contradictions in requirements | Surface conflicting goals before technical clarification |
| Accepting vague terms at face value | Disambiguate every technical term |
| Assuming scope without verification | Ask explicit boundary questions |
| Not questioning "must have" requirements | Understand WHY behind constraints |
| Doing deep research during clarification | Quick checks only, save research for brainstorming |
| Proposing solutions while clarifying | Stay in understanding mode, no design yet |
| Skipping clarification when "seems clear" | Always clarify, assumptions are dangerous |

## When to Stop Clarifying

Stop and move to brainstorming when:
- Contradictions are resolved (trade-offs explicitly chosen)
- Technical terms are disambiguated
- Scope boundaries are explicit
- Constraints are understood (not just stated)
- Assumptions are verified
- No major ambiguities remain

**You don't need perfect information** - just enough to brainstorm effectively.

If brainstorming reveals new ambiguities, you can return to clarification.

## Integration with Design Workflow

This skill sits between context gathering and brainstorming:

```
Context Gathering (start-design-plan Phase 1)
  -> User provides: "Build OAuth2 integration for our API"

Clarification (this skill)
  -> Disambiguate: Which OAuth2 flow? What scope? Why OAuth2?
  -> Output: Service accounts, client credentials, PCI compliance

Brainstorming (start-design-plan Phase 4)
  -> Explore: Architecture options, library choices, implementation phases
  -> Uses clarified requirements as foundation
```

**Purpose:** Ensure brainstorming builds the right thing, not the wrong thing well.
