  We ignore leap years so that we can get consistent results
  for various values used in the model that should not change
  every four years.  If we want to change this value for leap
  years, instead use the following code:


  IF THEN ELSE(
     (MODULO(Time, 4) = 0 :AND: MODULO(Time, 100) <> 0) :OR: MODULO(Time, 400) = 0,
     8784 {leap year},
     8760 {normal year}
  )
  }
  ~  hours
  ~  Calculates the number of hours in the year, ignoring leap years.
