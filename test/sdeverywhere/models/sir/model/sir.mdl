		The SIR Model of Infectious Disease
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is the classic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model of infectious \
		disease.	Infectious individuals remain infectious for a constant average
		period, then recover.
		
		In this version, the contact rate can be set to increase linearly,
		and the population is challenged by the arrival of a single infectious
		individual every 50 days.  Illustrates herd immunity.  Chapter 9.
	|

Infectious Population I= INTEG (
	Infection Rate-Recovery Rate,
		1)
	~	People
	~	The infectious population accumulates the infection rate and the \
		inmigration of infectious rate less the recovery rate.
	|

Initial Contact Rate=
	2.5
	~	1/Day
	~	The initial contact rate; the actual contact rate rises at a slope \
		determined by the user.
	|

Contact Rate c=
	Initial Contact Rate
	~	1/Day
	~	People in the community interact at a certain rate (the Contact Rate, c, \
		measured in people contacted per person per time period, or 1/time \
		periods).  The contact rate rises at the Ramp Slope starting in day 1.
	|

Reproduction Rate=
	Contact Rate c*Infectivity i*Average Duration of Illness d*Susceptible Population S/\
		Total Population P
	~	Dimensionless
	~		|

Total Population P=
	10000
	~	People
	~	The total population is constant
	|

Infection Rate=
	Contact Rate c*Infectivity i*Susceptible Population S*Infectious Population I/Total Population P
	~	People/Day
	~	The infection rate is the total number of encounters Sc multiplied by the \
		probability that any of those encounters is with an infectious individual \
		I/N, and finally multiplied by the probability that an encounter with an \
		infectious person results in infection i.
	|

Average Duration of Illness d=
	2
	~	Day
	~	The average length of time that a person is infectious.
	|

Recovered Population R= INTEG (
	Recovery Rate,
		0)
	~	People
	~	The recovered population R accumulates the recovery rate
	|

Recovery Rate=
	Infectious Population I/Average Duration of Illness d
	~	People/Day
	~	The rate at which the infected population recover and become immune to the \
		infection.
	|

Infectivity i=
	0.25
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The infectivity (i) of the disease is the probability that a person will \
		become infected after exposure to someone with the disease.
	|

Susceptible Population S= INTEG (
	-Infection Rate,
		Total Population P - Infectious Population I -  Recovered Population R)
	~	People
	~	The susceptible population, as in the simple logistic epidemic model, is \
		reduced by the infection rate.  The initial susceptible population is the \
		total population less the initial number of infectives and any initially \
		recovered individuals.
