	The software you are using allows you to explore the behavior and 
	sensitivity of the World3-03 model used in the book "Limites to Growth:
	The 30 Year Update," by Donella Meadows, Dennis Meadows and Jørgen 
	Randers.  This model is based on the World3 model which is documented 
	in detail in "The Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World," by Dennis 
	Meadows et al.  The World3-03 model contains a number of changes that 
	allow different technological assumptions and assertions to be tested.
	It also has new output measures of welfare and the human ecological 
	footprint.

	The software allows you to explore the model by means of buttons, menus,
	and output screens.  To activate a button, click on it.  To select a menu
	item, you can click on it, type the first letter in the menu description,
	or select it using the up and down	arrow keys and then press the Enter key.
	The selected menu item appears highlighted - usually black on white.  

	Additional functionality available in the software is described in 
	places where it can be used.  To conserve space, later commentaries
	will be kept small, and you will need to scroll them to read all the
	information they contain.

	Anything you type will appear as the name of the scenario.  

	You can change any constants or lookup tables in the model. The 
	values that have been changed in "Beyond the Limits" can be 
	accessed through through the first three change buttons.
	Any Constant in the model (including those in the first three buttons)
	can be changed using the constants button.  The Table functions
	in the model can be changed using the tables button.  Table (or Lookup)
	functions are nonlinear relationships relating an input to an output.
	The lookup table editor is graphically oriented.  You can drag points 
	around, or click where you would like new points to appear.

	The Escape key is used to back out of dialog boxes, without recording
	changes, and after one, two, or at most three times will return you 
	to this screen.  

	When you click on Run the scenario, your scenario will be run using 
	the changes you have entered.  After your scenario runs you will see
	a graph that has the same structure as the "State of the World" 
	graphs shown in "Beyond the Limits," but showing values for the 
	assumptions you have made.  If you have based your scenario on one of
	the predefined scenarios, and not changed any assumptions, the graph 
	should match the corresponding graph in the book.

	You can perform analysis of the model by first loading in scenarios of 
	interest, and then reviewing the output or doing causal tracing.  
	Scenarios that you have run are automatically loaded for analysis.
	The Load and reorder command will put up a small window with two lists.  
	On the left is a list of loaded scenarios, on the right a list of 
	scenarios that have been run.  The << button loads scenarios.  Click 
	on the scenario you want to load in the right hand list, and then 
	click the << button.  The >> button unloads scenarios.  Click on the 
	scenario you want to unload in the left hand list, and the click on 
	the >> button.

	You can load up to 8 scenarios at a time, but it is difficult to read
	graphs with more than 4 scenarios loaded.

	If the list on the right is empty, you will need to run some 
	scenarios.  Exit back to the Main Menu and do this.  You can run
	the scenarios described in "Beyond the Limits" by choosing one
	of the named scenarios as base for your scenario, and running the
	scenario without making any additional changes.

	The two graphs used to review scenarios throughout "Beyond the
	Limits" can be accessed for the first loaded scenario by clicking
	the buttons State of the world or Material standard of living.

	Causal tracing is a process that allows you to determine the underlying
	causes of behavior, and the differences in behavior between different
	scenarios.  There are two options for doing causal tracing.	 The first 
	uses tree diagrams and single graphs.  The second uses	equations and 
	multiple graphs.  Try them both to see which you prefer.

	The cause and use screens show lists of
	different variables.  The graphs allow
	you to compare different scenarios.
	The trees allow you to investigate the
	structure of the model.

	To view the causes, graphs, or uses of a
	variable, double click on its name anywhere
	it appears: in the graphs, trees, or 
	documentation.  You can select a new working 
	variable to trace by clicking on the button 
	Select a new variable to trace.

	You can print the contents of the graphs
	and trees by clicking on Print, or pressing
	P.  Output will be directed to your default 
	printer.

	During causal tracing, you can switch
	between the Tree and Graph represen-
	tations of causes.  This can be useful 
	as means of understanding both
	structure and behavior.

	Use the Tab key or mouse to move between the number entry and 
	table positions. To change the lookup tables, click the appropriate 
	table, and modify it graphically by dragging points around, 
	or type in new XY pairs.

	Changes you make to tables are recorded when you click OK on the table
	changing window.  Changes you make to constants are recorded when you
	click the button Record constant changes.  You can exit without 
	recording any changes you made by clicking on the Exit without
	recording... button.
