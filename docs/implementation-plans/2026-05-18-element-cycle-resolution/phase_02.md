# Element-Level Cycle Resolution — Phase 2 Implementation Plan

**Goal:** A multi-variable element-acyclic recurrence SCC evaluates in
interleaved per-element order, in **both** the dt (flows) and init (initials)
phases.

**Architecture:** Phase 1 resolves single-variable self-recurrences (they
already lower correctly within their one existing fragment). A *multi-variable*
recurrence SCC (e.g. C-LEARN's emissions/target cluster, or `ref.mdl`'s
`ce`/`ecc`) needs its members evaluated in interleaved per-element order across
variables — inexpressible with today's one-contiguous-`AssignCurr`-block-per-
variable lowering. Phase 2 adds a **combined-fragment lowering path**:
interleave the SCC members' per-element lowered `Expr::AssignCurr` slices in
the computed `element_order` into one synthetic `PerVarBytecodes`, inject it at
the SCC's runlist slot, and skip the members during per-variable fragment
collection. Variable layout offsets and the results map are unchanged (the
combined fragment writes the same `member_base + elem` slots, just reordered),
so per-variable result series stay individually addressable.

**Tech Stack:** Rust (`simlin-engine`), salsa, `compiler::Expr` lowering,
`compiler::symbolic` bytecode assembly.

**Scope:** Phase 2 of 7. **Depends on Phase 1** (Tarjan promotion, the
per-element dt relation builder + verdict, `ResolvedScc`/`SccPhase`/
`resolved_sccs`).

**Codebase verified:** 2026-05-18 (branch `clearn-hero-model`).

---

## Design deviations (verified — these override the design doc)

1. **REVISED (supersedes the original deviation #1; see GH #575).
   `Expr::AssignCurr` operands are per-variable *mini-slots*, NOT
   cross-member-comparable absolute model slots.** `var_phase_lowered_exprs_prod`
   → `lower_var_fragment` (`db_var_fragment.rs:532-877`) builds a *fresh
   per-variable mini-layout*: `mini_offset` starts at
   `crate::vm::IMPLICIT_VAR_COUNT` (=4 for root), the variable itself is
   placed first, then its own deps, then implicit vars;
   `rmap = ReverseOffsetMap::from_layout(&mini_layout)`. So every SCC member's
   own variable sits at slot 4 in *its own* layout, every member's
   `AssignCurr` write-slots collide, and a member's cross-member reads land on
   *that member's private* dep mini-slots. Consequently the original plan's
   "interleave raw `Vec<Expr>` and recompile through one shared context"
   mechanism is **unimplementable**, and Phase 1's `phase_element_order` (which
   keys an element graph on raw `AssignCurr` slots) builds **zero cross-member
   edges** for any multi-member SCC — it produces a wrong topological order
   *and* (fatally) resolves a genuine multi-variable element cycle
   (`a[i]=b[i];b[i]=a[i]`) as acyclic (unsound, violates the AC4 loud-safe
   hard rule). It is masked today only by the `members.len() != 1`
   short-circuit in `refine_scc_to_element_verdict` (`db_dep_graph.rs:1023`),
   which this phase must remove.

   **Both the multi-member verdict AND the combined-fragment interleave must
   operate at the SYMBOLIC layer.** `compile_var_fragment`'s `compile_phase`
   closure (`db.rs:~3670-3757`) already compiles a variable's phase exprs
   through its own correct mini-context and `symbolize_bytecode`s the result
   into a `PerVarBytecodes { symbolic: SymbolicByteCode, .. }` whose every
   variable reference is a layout-independent `SymVarRef { name: String,
   element_offset: usize }` (`compiler/symbolic.rs:37-42`). `SymVarRef` IS the
   cross-member-comparable identity the verdict and the interleave need.
   `concatenate_fragments`/`renumber_opcode` (`symbolic.rs:1218-1400`) already
   merge `&[&PerVarBytecodes]` with per-fragment resource renumbering;
   `resolve_module` (`symbolic.rs:826-` / the `assemble_module` call site)
   resolves `SymVarRef` → real model offsets at assembly so variable layout
   offsets and the results map are unchanged. The plan's "recompile the
   combined `Vec<Expr>`" is replaced by "compile each member independently
   (existing `compile_phase`), split each member's `SymbolicByteCode` into
   per-element segments delimited by its per-element write opcode
   (`AssignCurr`/`AssignConstCurr`/`BinOpAssignCurr`, element id =
   `SymVarRef.element_offset`), and interleave the segments in
   `ResolvedScc.element_order` with per-member resource renumbering — a
   per-element-granular generalization of `concatenate_fragments`."
2. **The runlist `Vec<String>` is salsa-owned and immutable at the
   `assemble_module` site** (`db.rs:4303-4307` reads `&ModelDepGraphResult`).
   "Remove members from the per-variable runlist" means **skip SCC members
   during fragment collection at `db.rs:4450-4486` and inject the synthetic
   combined fragment there**, not mutate the `Vec<String>`.
3. **Init phase does NOT use `concatenate_fragments`.** Flows/stocks use
   `concatenate_fragments` (`db.rs:4556`/`4567`); **initials are renumbered
   one-fragment-at-a-time into `Vec<SymbolicCompiledInitial>` keyed by each
   variable's `Ident`** (`db.rs:4583-4635`, key at `db.rs:4617-4619`). A
   combined init-phase fragment becomes ONE `SymbolicCompiledInitial` with one
   synthetic ident — **representability through `resolve_module`
   (`db.rs:4719`) is the single highest-priority verification gap** and is
   addressed by a spike task FIRST (Task 1), with a loud-safe fallback.
4. **No `init_walk_successors` exists.** The init successor relation is
   inlined in `compute_inner` at `db.rs:1206-1214`
   (`info.initial_deps` filtered to `var_info.contains_key`, **no
   stock-breaking**; the dt stock sink `db.rs:1171-1175` is `!is_initial`-
   gated). Phase 2 extracts a `pub(crate) fn init_walk_successors` in
   `db_dep_graph.rs` and refactors `compute_inner` to call it (matching the
   `db_dep_graph.rs` "single shared relation, never re-derive" pattern).
5. **No init-isolating fixture exists.** `ref.mdl`, `interleaved.mdl`,
   `self_recurrence.mdl` are all stock-free aux-only (their recurrence sits in
   *both* dt and init relations only incidentally). AC2.4 (an init-phase
   recurrence where a stock breaks the dt chain but **not** the init chain)
   needs a **new fixture** authored in this phase.
6. **No bytecode-determinism test exists.** AC2.3's byte-stable combined
   fragment is a new test obligation (relation/SCC-level determinism is
   already tested at `db_dep_graph_tests.rs:204-222`/`94-110`).
7. **`incremental_compilation_covers_all_models`
   (`tests/simulate.rs:1525-1569`) skips `.mdl`** (filters to
   `.stmx`/`.xmile`, `simulate.rs:1540`), so `ref.mdl`/`interleaved.mdl` are
   not auto-covered there; AC2.6 is about the existing 22-model
   `ALL_INCREMENTALLY_COMPILABLE_MODELS` + `TEST_MODELS` set staying green.

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

### element-cycle-resolution.AC2: Multi-variable recurrence SCC resolves
- **element-cycle-resolution.AC2.1 Success:** `test/sdeverywhere/models/ref/ref.mdl` compiles and simulates to its hand-computed per-element series.
- **element-cycle-resolution.AC2.2 Success:** `test/sdeverywhere/models/interleaved/interleaved.mdl` compiles and simulates to its hand-computed values.
- **element-cycle-resolution.AC2.3 Success:** The SCC is lowered as one combined fragment; variable offsets and the results offset map are unchanged vs. a hypothetical acyclic equivalent (per-variable result series remain individually addressable).
- **element-cycle-resolution.AC2.4 Success:** Both dt-phase and init-phase recurrence SCCs are resolved (a fixture with an init-phase recurrence simulates correctly).
- **element-cycle-resolution.AC2.5 Edge:** `ref_interleaved_inter_variable_cycles_report_circular` is transitioned to assert correct simulation (not `CircularDependency`).
- **element-cycle-resolution.AC2.6 Failure:** `incremental_compilation_covers_all_models` and the existing model corpus stay green (no regression on non-recurrence models).

---

## Testing conventions

Same as Phase 1: TDD mandatory; `db_dep_graph.rs` unit tests in
`db_dep_graph_tests.rs`; `assemble_module`/bytecode unit tests in `db.rs`'s
in-module `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` or a sibling `db_*_tests.rs` per the
per-file-line-cap convention; end-to-end fixtures in `tests/simulate.rs`
(`--features file_io`). Verify via `git commit` (pre-commit, 180s cap, never
`--no-verify`). `ref.mdl`/`interleaved.mdl` are tiny — no `#[ignore]`.

<!-- START_TASK_1 -->
### Task 1: SPIKE — init-phase combined-fragment representability

**Verifies:** none (de-risking spike; gates Task 6's design)

**Files:**
- Read only: `src/simlin-engine/src/db.rs:4583-4635` (init `SymbolicCompiledInitial` renumbering), `db.rs:4617-4619` (per-ident keying), `db.rs:4719` (`resolve_module`), the `SymbolicCompiledInitial` definition, and the downstream init-resolution/consumption path.
- Write: `docs/implementation-plans/2026-05-18-element-cycle-resolution/phase_02_spike_findings.md` (the decided mechanism + fallback).

**Implementation:**
This is an infrastructure/investigation task (no TDD). Determine **how a
combined init-phase fragment can be represented** given that initials are
renumbered per-`Ident` into `Vec<SymbolicCompiledInitial>` and resolved
per-variable. Concretely answer:
- Is `compiled_initials` consumed strictly per-variable-ident downstream of
  `db.rs:4719`, or can a single `SymbolicCompiledInitial` carrying a synthetic
  ident write multiple members' init slots?
- Can the combined init fragment be emitted as one `SymbolicCompiledInitial`
  with a synthetic ident whose bytecode writes each member's
  `member_base + elem` init slot (the same offsets, reordered), analogous to
  the flows combined fragment? Verify `resolve_module` and the init code
  generation do not assume a 1:1 ident↔init-slot mapping.
- If representable: record the exact mechanism (where to inject, what ident,
  how offsets stay correct).
- If NOT cleanly representable: record the **loud-safe fallback** — resolve dt
  combined fragments normally, but for an init-phase recurrence SCC keep
  `has_cycle`/`CircularDependency` (conservative). NOTE: C-LEARN reports both
  a dt and an init cycle, so the fallback would leave C-LEARN blocked on
  init; the spike must therefore push to find a representable mechanism (e.g.
  emit per-member `SymbolicCompiledInitial`s whose bytecodes are individually
  correct but ordered so cross-member element dependencies are satisfied —
  feasible only if init slots are written, not accumulated; verify).
- **HARD GATE — STOP and surface, do not silently fall back.** If the spike
  concludes the init combined fragment is **not** representable by any
  mechanism, the implementation MUST STOP and surface to the user before
  proceeding past this task. Do **not** silently apply the loud-safe init
  fallback: it strands AC2.4 *and* leaves C-LEARN's init cycle blocked (Phase
  6 depends on Phase 2), so it is a plan-invalidating outcome that requires a
  human decision, not an autonomous degrade. Also file via the `track-issue`
  agent. Only proceed to Tasks 2-6 once the spike has a representable init
  mechanism (or the user has explicitly accepted a revised scope).

**Verification:**
The findings doc exists and unambiguously states the chosen init mechanism
(or the fallback + its consequence for C-LEARN). Reviewed before Task 6.

### Task 2: Extract `init_walk_successors` and refactor `compute_inner`

**Verifies:** element-cycle-resolution.AC2.4 (init relation foundation), element-cycle-resolution.AC2.6 (no behavior change for existing models)

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db_dep_graph.rs` (add `pub(crate) fn init_walk_successors`, mirroring `dt_walk_successors` at `db_dep_graph.rs:83-103`)
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db.rs:1206-1214` (`compute_inner` init branch calls the new fn)

**Implementation:**
Add `pub(crate) fn init_walk_successors<'a>(var_info: &'a HashMap<String, VarInfo>, name: &str) -> Vec<&'a str>` returning:
- `[]` if `name` absent or the var is a Module (module early-return applies to
  both phases, `db.rs:1178-1186`);
- otherwise `var_info[name].initial_deps` (`VarInfo.initial_deps`,
  `db_dep_graph.rs:48`) filtered **only** to `var_info.contains_key(dep)` —
  **NO stock filter and NO stock sink** (a stock is a valid init-relation
  node; the dt stock sink `db.rs:1171-1175` is `!is_initial`-gated). This
  exactly reproduces the current inlined init logic at `db.rs:1209-1211`.
- Return in `BTreeSet`-sorted order (deterministic, like `dt_walk_successors`).

Refactor `compute_inner`'s `db.rs:1206-1214` so the `is_initial` branch calls
`init_walk_successors(var_info, name)` and the else branch keeps
`dt_walk_successors(var_info, name)`. This is a **pure refactor** — behavior
must be byte-identical (the relation is now shared by construction, matching
the `db_dep_graph.rs` "single shared relation, never re-derive" pattern, so
later init introspection observes the engine's actual relation).

**Testing:**
`db_dep_graph_tests.rs`: a unit test asserting `init_walk_successors` returns
BTreeSet-sorted, omits modules, includes stock deps (no stock break), matches
`db.rs:1209-1211` semantics on a small fixture. Regression: the existing
corpus must be unchanged — covered operationally by the suite + Task 9's
`incremental_compilation_covers_all_models`.

**Verification:**
Run: `cargo test -p simlin-engine --features file_io init_walk_successors` and
the broader cycle tests — green (pure refactor).
**Commit:** `engine: extract init_walk_successors, share the init relation`
<!-- END_TASK_2 -->

<!-- START_TASK_3 -->
### Task 3: Init-phase per-element relation + verdict

**Verifies:** element-cycle-resolution.AC2.4

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db_dep_graph.rs` (init-phase SCC identification + per-element relation + verdict, reusing the Phase 1 builder parameterized by phase)
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db.rs` `model_dependency_graph_impl` init `has_cycle` block (`db.rs:1273-1287`)

**Implementation:**
Parameterize the Phase 1 per-element relation builder + verdict by `SccPhase`:
- Init SCC identification: same as dt but over `init_walk_successors`
  adjacency (Task 2). Self-loops detected directly from the init adjacency.
- Per-element init relation: for each member, source production **init**
  lowered exprs via `var_phase_lowered_exprs_prod(.., SccPhase::Initial)`
  (Phase 1 Task 3 accessor; it already selects `per_phase_lowered.initial`).
  Build `(member, element)` nodes/edges from the init `AssignCurr` RHS reads,
  exactly as the dt builder does. Init-phase semantics inherited: stocks do
  **not** break the init chain (init lowered exprs include the stock's init
  equation), `initial_previous_referenced_vars` already stripped by
  `build_var_info` (`db_dep_graph.rs:189`).
- Verdict: element-acyclic + element-sourceable ⇒ `ResolvedScc { phase: SccPhase::Initial, .. }`;
  else keep `CircularDependency` (loud-safe).
- Consume in `model_dependency_graph_impl`'s init block (`db.rs:1273-1287`)
  symmetrically to Phase 1 Task 5's dt block: a resolved init SCC is excluded
  from the init `CircularDependency` accumulation and recorded in
  `resolved_sccs` with `phase == Initial`.

**Testing:**
`db_dep_graph_tests.rs`: an init-phase recurrence `TestProject` where a stock
breaks the dt chain but the init relation has a forward element recurrence —
assert a `ResolvedScc { phase: Initial }` is produced and dt has no cycle. A
genuine init element cycle ⇒ unresolved (`CircularDependency`).

**Verification:**
Run: `cargo test -p simlin-engine --features file_io` init-phase tests — pass.

### Task 4: Symbolic per-member fragment accessor + multi-member symbolic element-graph verdict (the correctness rebuild — GH #575)

**Verifies:** element-cycle-resolution.AC2.1, element-cycle-resolution.AC2.4, element-cycle-resolution.AC4 (loud-safe: genuine multi-variable element cycles stay rejected)

**Why this task exists:** Phase 1's `phase_element_order` builds the SCC
element graph from raw per-variable mini-slots and is structurally incapable
of cross-member edges (GH #575): for any multi-member SCC it produces a wrong
order *and* resolves a genuine multi-variable element cycle as acyclic
(unsound). Phase 2 must resolve multi-member SCCs, so the verdict's
element-graph construction must be rebuilt on the cross-member-comparable
**symbolic** representation BEFORE the combined fragment (Task 5) can consume
a correct `ResolvedScc`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db.rs` — add a `pub(crate)` accessor
  returning a variable's *symbolic* `PerVarBytecodes` for a phase (factor the
  existing `compile_phase` closure in `compile_var_fragment` so the SCC path
  reuses the exact production compile+symbolize, never a re-derivation).
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db_dep_graph.rs` — replace the mini-slot
  element-graph construction (`phase_element_order` / `slot_to_node` /
  `member_elements` / `element_node_key` / the `Expr`-based
  `collect_read_slots`) with a symbolic builder over `SymVarRef`; remove the
  `members.len() != 1` guard in `refine_scc_to_element_verdict`
  (`db_dep_graph.rs:1023`).

**Implementation:**
- **Accessor:** add `pub(crate) fn var_phase_symbolic_fragment_prod(db, model,
  project, var_name, phase: SccPhase) -> Option<PerVarBytecodes>`. It must
  reuse the *exact* production compile+symbolize path: factor the
  `compile_phase` closure body out of `compile_var_fragment`
  (`db.rs:~3670-3757`) into a `pub(crate)` helper taking the caller-owned
  context (`offsets`, `rmap`, `tables`, `module_refs`, `mini_offset`,
  `converted_dims`, `dim_context`, `model_name_ident`, `inputs`) + the phase
  `Vec<Expr>`, returning `Option<PerVarBytecodes>`; the accessor builds that
  context exactly as `var_phase_lowered_exprs_prod` does (mirror it
  byte-for-byte; select `per_phase_lowered.noninitial` for `Dt`, `.initial`
  for `Initial`), then calls the factored helper. `None` is the loud-safe
  signal (no `SourceVariable`, `Fatal`, `Var::new` error, or compile/
  symbolize failure) — never panic. `var_phase_lowered_exprs_prod` stays
  (Phase 3 still extends its no-`SourceVariable` arm); the symbolic accessor
  is the new SCC-graph source.
- **Symbolic element graph (replaces `phase_element_order`):** for each SCC
  member, get its symbolic `PerVarBytecodes` for the phase. Walk
  `symbolic.code`:
  - A per-element **write** is `SymbolicOpcode::AssignCurr { var } |
    AssignConstCurr { var, .. } | BinOpAssignCurr { var, .. }` where
    `var.name == member`. It defines node `(var.name.clone(),
    var.element_offset)` and terminates the current element segment.
  - The **reads** consumed by that element are the `SymVarRef`s in the
    opcodes since the previous write (inclusive of this write's own operand
    sub-expression already flattened into preceding stack ops):
    `LoadVar{var} | SymLoadPrev{var} | SymLoadInitial{var} |
    LoadSubscript{var} | PushVarView{var,..} | PushVarViewDirect{var,..}`,
    and `PushStaticView{view_id}` → resolve `static_views[view_id].base`; if
    `SymStaticViewBase::Var(v)` enumerate the exact element set the view
    addresses (mirror Phase 1 `collect_read_slots`'s `StaticSubscript`
    dims/strides/offset enumeration, but in symbolic space — exact, not an
    over-approximation, so genuinely element-acyclic models like `ref.mdl`
    still resolve). Reuse/adapt the existing
    `sym_var_refs_in_bytecode` enumeration shape (`symbolic.rs:767-782`) but
    split read-opcodes vs the write terminal and add the static-view base
    resolution.
  - For every read `SymVarRef { name, element_offset }` whose `name` is an
    SCC member, add edge `(name, element_offset) -> (write.name,
    write.element_offset)`. Over-approximation remains the loud-safe
    direction (preserve Phase 1's documented `collect_read_slots` contract:
    an extra edge only forces a conservative `CircularDependency`, never a
    wrong order; `SymLoadPrev` is included as an edge exactly as the
    `Expr`-level `Previous`-arg was — PREVIOUS-only recurrences stay
    protected upstream by `build_var_info`'s `dt_previous` strip at SCC
    *identification*, unchanged).
  - Node identity is the `(canonical-name, element_offset)` pair encoded
    byte-stably for `crate::ltm::scc_components` (keep the existing injective
    `element_node_key` U+241F scheme — it is already an opaque graph key — or
    an equivalent; `name` is a real canonical variable name here so it is
    well-formed). Element self-loop or element multi-SCC ⇒ `None`
    (unresolved, loud-safe). Acyclic ⇒ deterministic topological order over
    `(member, element)` (same sorted Kahn/tie-break discipline as Phase 1,
    so byte-stable).
- **Unify N=1 and N≥2.** `refine_scc_to_element_verdict` drops the
  `members.len() != 1` short-circuit and calls the symbolic builder for all
  SCCs; single-variable self-recurrence is just the N=1 case of the same
  builder. The `SccPhase::Dt`/`Initial` branch structure (Dt requires
  init-element-acyclicity too; Initial is init-only) is preserved exactly.
  All Phase 1 + Subcomponent A single-member regression guards
  (`self_recurrence_resolves_and_no_self_token_leak`,
  `genuine_cycles_still_rejected`, `resolve_dt_*`, `resolve_init_*`,
  `dt_cycle_sccs_*`, byte-stability) MUST stay green unchanged — they encode
  the correct single-member behavior.

**Testing (RED-first, `db_dep_graph_tests.rs`):**
- A two-member `ref.mdl`-shaped SCC (`ce`/`ecc`, `ce[tNext]=ecc[tPrev]+1;
  ecc[tNext]=ce[tNext]+1`) ⇒ `Resolved` with the correct **interleaved**
  `element_order` (ce[0],ecc[0],ce[1],ecc[1],…) — RED before the rebuild
  (today it is short-circuited `Unresolved`), GREEN after.
- A genuine multi-variable element 2-cycle (`a[i]=b[i]; b[i]=a[i]`) ⇒
  `Unresolved` (the GH #575 unsoundness fix — this is the load-bearing
  correctness assertion; it must fail RED if the symbolic builder is wrong).
- A genuine scalar 2-cycle (`a=b+1; b=a+1`) ⇒ `Unresolved`.
- Single-variable forward self-recurrence ⇒ `Resolved`, byte-identical
  `element_order` to Phase 1 (regression: N=1 unchanged).
- `interleaved.mdl`-shaped element-acyclic-through-2-cycle ⇒ `Resolved`.
- A member whose symbolic fragment is unsourceable ⇒ `Unresolved`, no panic.

**Verification:**
Run: `cargo test -p simlin-engine --features file_io --lib db_dep_graph` —
RED on the new multi-member + unsoundness tests before, GREEN after, and the
entire existing `db_dep_graph` suite still green (no single-member
regression).

### Task 5: Interleave members' symbolic per-element segments into one combined `PerVarBytecodes`

**Verifies:** element-cycle-resolution.AC2.1, element-cycle-resolution.AC2.3

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db.rs` (a new `pub(crate)` helper that, given a `ResolvedScc` and its members' symbolic `PerVarBytecodes` from the Task 4 accessor, produces one combined `PerVarBytecodes`)

**Implementation:**
Each member's symbolic `PerVarBytecodes` (Task 4 accessor) is, for an arrayed
member, a sequence of per-element computations each ending in that element's
write opcode (`SymbolicOpcode::AssignCurr | AssignConstCurr | BinOpAssignCurr`
with `var.name == member`, element id = `var.element_offset`). Build one
combined `PerVarBytecodes` whose element writes follow
`ResolvedScc.element_order`:
- **Segment** each member's `symbolic.code` into per-element slices: the slice
  for element `e` is the run of opcodes up to and including the write opcode
  whose `var.element_offset == e` (strip any trailing `Ret`). Validate every
  member element in `element_order` maps to exactly one segment (a missing /
  duplicate / non-contiguous segment ⇒ loud-safe error, caller keeps
  `CircularDependency`).
- **Resources are member-scoped, not element-scoped.** Compute each member's
  resource base offsets (literals, graphical_functions, module_decls,
  static_views, temp_sizes, dim_lists) ONCE per member exactly as
  `concatenate_fragments` (`symbolic.rs:1218-1309`) computes them per
  fragment, and apply that member's offsets (via the existing
  `renumber_opcode`, `symbolic.rs:1327-1400`) to every opcode in every
  segment of that member. Merge the side-channels per member exactly as
  `concatenate_fragments` does (this is a per-element-granular generalization
  of `concatenate_fragments`; factor the shared renumber/merge logic rather
  than duplicating it).
- **Emit** the renumbered segments in `ResolvedScc.element_order` order,
  concatenated, followed by a single trailing `SymbolicOpcode::Ret`. Each
  write keeps its original `SymVarRef { name, element_offset }` (only segment
  ordering changes), so after `resolve_module` the variable layout offsets
  and the results map are unchanged (AC2.3) and per-variable series remain
  individually addressable.
- Determinism: `element_order` is byte-stable (Task 4 sorted topo);
  per-member resource offsets are assigned in `element_order`'s member
  first-encounter order; the interleave is a pure reordering ⇒ the combined
  `PerVarBytecodes` is byte-stable.

**Testing:**
`db.rs` in-module `#[cfg(test)]`: given a hand-built two-member SCC with known
member symbolic `PerVarBytecodes` and a known `element_order`, assert the
combined `PerVarBytecodes`: segments appear in `element_order`; every member
element's write `SymVarRef` is present exactly once with its original
`name`/`element_offset`; exactly one trailing `Ret`; per-member resource ids
correctly renumbered (no collision across members); side-channels merged.
Numeric correctness is the Task 7/8 end-to-end job — keep this unit focused on
structural well-formedness.

**Verification:**
Run: `cargo test -p simlin-engine --features file_io combined_fragment` (new
test name) — pass.

### Task 5b: Consume the resolved multi-member SCC in the dependency graph (SCC-aware back-edge break + contiguous placement)

**Verifies:** element-cycle-resolution.AC2.1, element-cycle-resolution.AC2.2, element-cycle-resolution.AC2.4, element-cycle-resolution.AC4 (loud-safe: genuine multi-variable cycles still rejected)

**Why this task exists (inserted prerequisite — GH #575 re-architecture):**
Phase 1 / Subcomponent A only ever taught `model_dependency_graph_impl`'s
`compute_transitive` to break a *self-edge* (`dep == name &&
resolvable_self_loops.contains(dep)`, `db.rs:~1311`). For a multi-member
resolved SCC the intra-SCC edges are *cross-edges* (`dep != name`), so the
guard is false, `compute_transitive` returns `Err`, the `.unwrap_or_else`
sets `has_cycle = true` and `resolved_sccs.clear()`, and `assemble_module`
early-returns at `if dep_graph.has_cycle` — Task 4/5's correct verdict +
combined fragment are unreachable. Tasks 6/7/8 (inject, ref.mdl,
interleaved.mdl) cannot work until the dependency graph treats a resolved
multi-member SCC as a single collapsed node. This is the N≥2 analogue of the
single-variable self-edge consumption Phase 1 added; it was implicitly
assumed present by the original plan.

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db.rs` `model_dependency_graph_impl`
  (`compute_transitive`/`compute_inner`, the `resolvable`/`resolved_sccs`
  construction, and the symmetric init block). Locate by name/content;
  report actual current line numbers.
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db_dep_graph.rs` — correct the
  `resolve_recurrence_sccs` rustdoc (`~:1166-1181`) that currently asserts
  the false N=1-only premise "the resolved member set only suppresses the
  resolved members' edges" (CLAUDE.md comment-freshness, same commit).

**Implementation:**
- Generalize the `resolvable_self_loops: &BTreeSet<String>` parameter
  threaded through `compute_transitive`/`compute_inner` into an **SCC-aware**
  structure mapping each resolved member name → a stable SCC id (e.g.
  `&BTreeMap<String, usize>` or `&HashMap<String, SccId>`), built from
  `resolution.resolved` (every member of `ResolvedScc` *i* maps to *i*). A
  single-variable self-recurrence is a **1-member SCC** under this map, so
  this *unifies and replaces* the N=1 self-edge mechanism — it is not a
  parallel path.
- Back-edge handling (the `processing.contains(dep)` site, `db.rs:~1299`):
  suppress (`continue`, no error) **iff `dep` and `name` are in the SAME
  resolved SCC** (`map.get(dep).is_some() && map.get(dep) == map.get(name)`).
  This covers the N=1 self-edge (`dep == name`, 1-member SCC) and N≥2
  cross-edges (`dep != name`, same SCC) uniformly. Any back-edge NOT within
  one resolved SCC still `return Err` (loud-safe: genuine cycles, a
  partially-resolved SCC, or a cross-SCC edge stay `CircularDependency`).
- Treat the resolved SCC as **one collapsed node** for transitive
  accumulation so external topological ordering is correct: every member of
  an SCC must end with the SAME transitive set = the union of all members'
  *external* (non-SCC) successors and their transitive deps; **no SCC member
  may appear in another SCC member's transitive set** (else the topo sort
  re-sees the cycle). The SCC is positioned after its external deps and
  before its external consumers.
- Deterministic contiguous placement: members of a resolved SCC must appear
  in the runlist grouped and in a byte-stable order at the SCC's topological
  slot, so Task 6's "inject one combined fragment at the first SCC member's
  slot, skip the rest" lands it in correct relative order. Reuse the existing
  byte-stable discipline (BTreeSet/sorted; `element_order` is already
  byte-stable from Task 4); the SCC's runlist position is what matters
  (Task 6 injects once and skips non-first members).
- With the SCC-aware break, `compute_transitive(false, &scc_map)` now returns
  `Ok` for a fully-resolved multi-member SCC, so `resolved_sccs` stays
  populated and `has_cycle = false`. Apply the **same generalization
  symmetrically to the init block** (it already mirrors the dt block).
- Loud-safe: a genuine multi-variable cycle (`a=b+1; b=a+1`;
  `a[i]=b[i]; b[i]=a[i]`) is NOT in `resolution.resolved` (Task 4's symbolic
  verdict returns it `Unresolved`), so it is absent from the SCC map, its
  back-edge still `Err`s ⇒ `has_cycle = true` ⇒ `CircularDependency`. A
  partially-resolved SCC (`has_unresolved`) keeps the conservative fallback.
- Honor the documented module-input scoping caveat (GH #573,
  `db_dep_graph.rs:~1158-1180`) — do not regress it.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** every Phase 1 + Subcomponent A single-variable
regression guard MUST stay green **unchanged** (`self_recurrence.mdl`
end-to-end, `self_recurrence_resolves_and_no_self_token_leak`,
`genuine_cycles_still_rejected`, all `resolve_dt_*`/`resolve_init_*`,
`dt_cycle_sccs_*`, byte-stability, `previous_self_reference_still_resolves`).
N=1 is the 1-member-SCC case of the generalized mechanism and must be
byte-identical. If a guard needs editing to pass, the generalization changed
N=1 behavior — STOP and report, do not edit the guard.

**Testing (RED-first, `db_dep_graph_tests.rs`):**
- A two-member `ref.mdl`-shaped SCC `TestProject` ⇒ `model_dependency_graph`:
  `has_cycle == false`, `resolved_sccs` contains the `{ce,ecc}` SCC,
  `dt_dependencies` non-empty and each member carries the SCC's external
  deps — RED before (today `has_cycle == true`, empty `resolved_sccs`), GREEN
  after.
- `interleaved.mdl`-shaped multi-member SCC ⇒ same (`has_cycle == false`,
  resolved).
- Genuine multi-variable element 2-cycle `a[i]=b[i]; b[i]=a[i]` and scalar
  `a=b+1; b=a+1` ⇒ `has_cycle == true`, empty `resolved_sccs` (loud-safe;
  the load-bearing AC4 assertion).
- An acyclic control ⇒ unaffected (empty `resolved_sccs`, `has_cycle ==
  false`).
- Regression: the single-variable self-recurrence `TestProject` ⇒
  byte-identical `resolved_sccs`/`element_order`/`has_cycle` to Phase 1.

**Verification:**
Run: `cargo test -p simlin-engine --features file_io --lib db_dep_graph` —
RED on the multi-member tests before, GREEN after, entire existing suite
green unchanged. Then `cargo test -p simlin-engine --features file_io` corpus
green. Commit via `git commit` (pre-commit full `cargo test` 180s cap; never
`--no-verify`; on hook failure fix + NEW commit, not `--amend`).

### Task 6: Inject the combined fragment in `assemble_module` (dt + init)

**Verifies:** element-cycle-resolution.AC2.1, element-cycle-resolution.AC2.2, element-cycle-resolution.AC2.3, element-cycle-resolution.AC2.4

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db.rs` `assemble_module` fragment-collection
  loops for flows; the init `SymbolicCompiledInitial` path per the **Task 1
  spike mechanism** (see `phase_02_spike_findings.md`). Locate the loops by
  name/content — line numbers shifted from Phase 1/2A edits; the Task 1 spike
  re-verified current locations (flow-fragment collection ~`db.rs:4615-4633`,
  init renumber loop ~`db.rs:4739-4795`, `resolve_module` ~`db.rs:4879`).

**Implementation:**
- Read `dep_graph.resolved_sccs` (the `ResolvedScc` payload, now correctly
  populated for multi-member SCCs by the Task 4 rebuild). For each
  `ResolvedScc`, build the combined `PerVarBytecodes` (Task 5) for its phase
  via the Task 4 symbolic accessor + Task 5 interleave.
- **Flows (dt):** in the `runlist_flows` fragment-collection loop, **skip**
  every dt-`ResolvedScc` member's per-variable `flow_bytecodes` push, and at
  the position of the first SCC member encountered, push the combined
  fragment's `&PerVarBytecodes` instead. The combined `PerVarBytecodes` must
  be **owned** somewhere that outlives the `concatenate_fragments` call (the
  existing vectors hold `&` borrows into `all_fragments`); allocate it in a
  local that lives to the end of `assemble_module` and push a reference. The
  runlist `Vec<String>` itself is **not** mutated (it is salsa-owned).
- **Initials (init):** apply the Task 1 spike's **validated** mechanism (HARD
  GATE PASSED, `phase_02_spike_findings.md`): for each init-`ResolvedScc`,
  emit ONE `SymbolicCompiledInitial` carrying a synthetic ident
  (`$⁚scc⁚init⁚{n}`) whose bytecode is the Task 5 combined fragment, at the
  first init SCC member's slot in the `initial_frags` collection loop, and
  skip the members' per-ident init entries. The spike verified
  `resolve_module`/`eval_initials` consume `compiled_initials` positionally
  (ident-agnostic) and that one `SymbolicCompiledInitial` may write multiple
  members' init slots, so this needs ZERO changes to `resolve_module` /
  `compute_layout` / the renumber loop / the VM init runner. If during
  implementation the spike's mechanism is found to genuinely contradict the
  code (not mere inconvenience), STOP and surface — the loud-safe init
  fallback is NOT an autonomous path.
- `concatenate_fragments` stays agnostic and unchanged — the combined
  fragment is just another `PerVarBytecodes`, mirroring how LTM synthetic
  fragments are appended.
- Variable layout (`compute_layout`) and `resolve_module` are untouched; the
  combined fragment's writes keep their original `SymVarRef`
  name/element_offset, so `resolve_module` maps them to the same model slots
  and the results offset map is unchanged (AC2.3).

**Testing:**
End-to-end via Tasks 7/8 (the real proof). Add a focused `db.rs`
`#[cfg(test)]` assertion that, for a resolved multi-variable SCC, the assembled
module's results offset map for each member is identical to the offsets a
hypothetical acyclic equivalent would get (AC2.3 — per-variable series
individually addressable), e.g. compare member offsets to the
non-SCC-member layout.

**Verification:**
Run: `cargo test -p simlin-engine --features file_io assemble` — pass.

<!-- END_SUBCOMPONENT_B -->

<!-- START_TASK_7 -->
### Task 7: End-to-end — `ref.mdl` compiles and simulates

**Verifies:** element-cycle-resolution.AC2.1

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/tests/simulate.rs` (add/repurpose a test for `test/sdeverywhere/models/ref/ref.mdl`; it has a sibling `ref.dat`)

**Implementation:**
`ref.mdl` is a two-variable inter-element recurrence (`ce[t1]=1;
ce[tNext]=ecc[tPrev]+1; ecc[t1]=ce[t1]+1; ecc[tNext]=ce[tNext]+1` over
subrange `t1..t3`). Its `ref.dat` encodes the hand-computed series
`ce[t1]=1, ce[t2]=3, ce[t3]=5, ecc[t1]=2, ecc[t2]=4, ecc[t3]=6` (constant
across both saved steps). Add a `#[test]` that runs `ref.mdl` through
`simulate_mdl_path` (`tests/simulate.rs:286-305`) which loads `ref.dat` via
`load_expected_results_for_mdl` and compares with `ensure_results`. (Note:
the assertion that `ref.mdl` is `CircularDependency` lives in
`ref_interleaved_inter_variable_cycles_report_circular` — Task 9 transitions
it; this Task 7 test asserts correct simulation.)

**Testing:**
The test IS AC2.1. It must fail before Tasks 4-6 (currently rejected) and pass
after (matches `ref.dat`).

**Verification:**
Run: `cargo test -p simlin-engine --features file_io ref_mdl` (or chosen
name) — passes against `ref.dat`.
**Commit:** `engine: ref.mdl multi-variable recurrence simulates (AC2.1)`
<!-- END_TASK_7 -->

<!-- START_TASK_8 -->
### Task 8: End-to-end — `interleaved.mdl` compiles and simulates

**Verifies:** element-cycle-resolution.AC2.2

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/tests/simulate.rs` (test for `test/sdeverywhere/models/interleaved/interleaved.mdl`; sibling `interleaved.dat`)

**Implementation:**
`interleaved.mdl`: `x=1; a[A1]=x; a[A2]=y; y=a[A1]; b[DimA]=a[DimA]`
(`DimA: A1,A2`). Whole-variable `a`↔`y` is a 2-cycle, but element-wise
`x → a[A1] → y → a[A2]` is acyclic. `interleaved.dat` = all `1.0` (101 steps).
Add a `#[test]` running it via `simulate_mdl_path`, comparing against
`interleaved.dat`.

**Testing:** The test IS AC2.2 (fails before, passes after Tasks 4-6).

**Verification:**
Run: `cargo test -p simlin-engine --features file_io interleaved` — passes.
**Commit:** `engine: interleaved.mdl element interleave simulates (AC2.2)`
<!-- END_TASK_8 -->

<!-- START_TASK_9 -->
### Task 9: Transition the inter-variable-cycle assertion + new init fixture

**Verifies:** element-cycle-resolution.AC2.4, element-cycle-resolution.AC2.5, element-cycle-resolution.AC2.6

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/tests/simulate.rs` `ref_interleaved_inter_variable_cycles_report_circular` (`tests/simulate.rs:1356-1387`)
- Create: `test/sdeverywhere/models/init_recurrence/init_recurrence.mdl` (+ `init_recurrence.dat` with hand-computed expected values) — a NEW init-phase-recurrence fixture
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/tests/simulate.rs` (a `#[test]` for the new init fixture)

**Implementation:**
- `ref_interleaved_inter_variable_cycles_report_circular` currently asserts
  `CircularDependency` for both `ref.mdl` and `interleaved.mdl`
  (`tests/simulate.rs:1366-1385`). Transition it to assert **correct
  simulation** for both (or fold its intent into Tasks 7/8 and replace this
  test's body with the correct-simulation assertions). The "no
  `UnknownDependency`/`DoesNotExist` leak" intent should be preserved as a
  guard if still meaningful (AC2.5).
- Author a **new init-phase recurrence fixture** (AC2.4): a model where a
  stock breaks the dt chain (so dt is acyclic) but the **init** relation has
  a forward element recurrence across variables (so only the init element
  graph exercises the combined init fragment). Hand-compute its expected
  series into `init_recurrence.dat` (follow the `ref`/`interleaved` fixture
  convention: `.mdl` + `.dat`). Add a `#[test]` running it via
  `simulate_mdl_path` asserting it simulates correctly — this is the AC2.4
  init-phase proof. (The executor must empirically confirm the chosen MDL
  shape actually produces an init-only element SCC by inspecting
  `resolved_sccs`/the init verdict; adjust the fixture until it does.)
- **Bounded-attempt + escalation:** if, after a reasonable bounded number of
  attempts (≈4-5 distinct MDL shapes — stock-init recurrence variants,
  different subrange/builtin combinations), no shape produces a genuine
  init-only element SCC (dt acyclic via a stock break, init element
  recurrence), STOP: do not fabricate a passing assertion or weaken AC2.4.
  Surface to the user and file via the `track-issue` agent (Task tool,
  `subagent_type: "track-issue"`) that an init-isolating fixture could not be
  constructed, with the shapes tried and the observed `resolved_sccs`/verdict
  output, so the gap is explicitly tracked rather than silently dropped.

**Testing:**
AC2.5 (transitioned test green), AC2.4 (new init fixture simulates), AC2.6
(no corpus regression — see Task 10).

**Verification:**
Run: `cargo test -p simlin-engine --features file_io ref_interleaved init_recurrence` — pass.
**Commit:** `engine: transition inter-variable-cycle test; add init-recurrence fixture (AC2.4, AC2.5)`
<!-- END_TASK_9 -->

<!-- START_TASK_10 -->
### Task 10: Byte-stable combined fragment + corpus regression gate

**Verifies:** element-cycle-resolution.AC2.3, element-cycle-resolution.AC2.6

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/simlin-engine/src/db.rs` `#[cfg(test)]` (combined-fragment byte-stability test) or `db_dep_graph_tests.rs`
- Verify only: `src/simlin-engine/tests/simulate.rs` `incremental_compilation_covers_all_models` (`tests/simulate.rs:1525-1569`)

**Implementation:**
- Add a determinism test: compile `ref.mdl` (or the multi-var `TestProject`)
  twice on fresh databases; assert the assembled combined fragment's
  bytecode/`resolved_sccs`/`element_order` are byte-identical across runs
  (new obligation — no existing bytecode-determinism test; model on
  `dt_cycle_sccs_is_byte_stable_across_runs:204-222`).
- Confirm `incremental_compilation_covers_all_models` (the 22-model
  `ALL_INCREMENTALLY_COMPILABLE_MODELS` + `TEST_MODELS`) stays green — no
  regression on non-recurrence models (AC2.6). This is the existing corpus
  gate; do not weaken it.

**Verification:**
Run the full engine suite via `git commit` (pre-commit `cargo test` under the
180s cap): `incremental_compilation_covers_all_models` green, new
determinism test green, all of `simulates_*` green.
**Commit:** `engine: byte-stable combined fragment; corpus regression gate green (AC2.3, AC2.6)`
<!-- END_TASK_10 -->

<!-- END_SUBCOMPONENT_C -->

---

## Phase 2 Done When

- `ref.mdl` and `interleaved.mdl` compile and simulate to their hand-computed
  values (Tasks 7, 8 — AC2.1, AC2.2).
- The SCC is one combined fragment; variable offsets and the results map are
  unchanged; per-variable series individually addressable (Tasks 4-6, 10 —
  AC2.3).
- Both dt and init recurrence SCCs resolve; the new init-phase fixture
  simulates (Tasks 1-3, 9 — AC2.4).
- `ref_interleaved_inter_variable_cycles_report_circular` transitioned to
  correct simulation (Task 9 — AC2.5).
- `incremental_compilation_covers_all_models` and the existing corpus stay
  green; combined fragment byte-stable (Task 10 — AC2.6).
- Full engine suite green under the 3-minute `cargo test` pre-commit cap.
